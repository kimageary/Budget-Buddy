# Budget Buddy

Budget buddy is a simple finance tracker allows you to input different expenses and income. You also have an accurate reading of your current account balance based on how many times you have submitted the income & expense form.

## Key Features

1. Expense Form - allows you to input expenses
    - Date - to track when the expense occured
    - Category - to track where the expense occured
    - Amount - to track how much the expense was
    - Expense type - breaks the expense into a need or a want
    - Description - allows for comments/reasoning behind the expense
2. Income Form - allows you to track income
    - Date - to track when the income occured
    - Category - to track where the income came from
    - Amount - to track how much income was earned
    - Source - Place to further break down where the income came from
    - Description - allows for comments/extra information tied to the income
3. See All - congregates all the date added to both the income and expense table into two distinct tables
4. Success routing shows dynamically displayed content based on whether a income or expense form was submitted.
5. Home page dynamically shows the current amount of income, expenses, and how much you have in your account based on how many income and expenses you have inputted.
6. Each web page is suitable for small, medium, and large screen sizes
7. A nav bar that dynamically drops down when clicked pops up when the web page gets smaller.

## Known Limitations

1. Sometimes when the web page has been newly launched, the nav bar feature does not immediatley work.
2. Not much is done with the data submitted besides showing it in the success page.
    - I had plans to make the web page do more with the data, such as including a pie chart that shows where you spend your money, but I ran out of time on this project.
    - I also wanted to show last month's expenses and income, but I couldn't figure out how to properly make the SQL query.
